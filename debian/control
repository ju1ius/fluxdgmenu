Description: An automated XDG Menu system for Fluxbox.
  FluXDGMenu monitors for newly installed/removed applications, and maintains a submenu, listing and categorizing them like the Gnome/Xfce/Lxde menu.
  The package installs a menu file "/etc/xdg/menus/fxm-applications.menu",
  which allows you to configure the menu as you see fit.
  For documentation, see: http://github.com/ju1ius/fluxdgmenu/wiki
  Features:
      * Auto generates and auto updates a Fluxbox "Applications" menu in compliance with www.freedesktop.org standards thereby giving a familiar menu.
      * Support for localizations: the menu generated will be in the system default language where available.
      * Support for icons: the icons are chosen in the current icon theme
      * Can also maintain a "GTK Bookmarks" and a "Recently used Files" menu
