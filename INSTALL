Debian systems
==============

If you're running a Debian based system or any distribution using apt and/or dpkg,
then you really should install the deb package, as fluxdgmenu uses dpkg triggers
to update the menu each time a package is installed/removed.
If you install from source, you'll need to run the menu daemon.


Installing from a package:
===========================

Debian package
--------------

After installing the package:

add the following line to your ~/.fluxbox/menu file
[include] (~/.fluxbox/fluxdgmenu/menu.cache)


Other types of packages
-----------------------

start the daemon
fxm-daemon start

If you want it to start automatically at login,
add the following line to your ~/.fluxbox/startup file
fxm-daemon start &

Then refer to the Debian package instructions
